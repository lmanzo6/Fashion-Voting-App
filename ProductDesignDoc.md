# IPro 497 – Product Design Document

## Problem statement

- Problem Statement #1: 

    - Young adult fashion enthuasiasts interested in upgrading their fashion style could use the app to discover new fashion styles, connect with the fashion community, and receive ratings and comments based on their uploaded outfits.

- Problem Statement #2:

    - Individuals interested in fashion are able to enhance their style by sharing and receiving feedback on their outfits from other users due to the lower bias that is provided by getting results from others interested in fashion, rather than from friends or family.

 
## Customer
- Young adult fashion enthusiasts (18+)

### Description

- The average person spends over $1,500 a year on new outfits to improve/update their fashion sense, but is it really worth it? When we ask our close friends/family about our outfits, they claim we look great, but is that the truth, or is it just what we want to hear? With our Fashion Voting app, young adult fashion enthusiasts are able to take their fashion to the next level by uploading photos of their outfits to gain a better sense of how their fashion style appeals to other users. Using this system, people will be able to receive feedback on their style and modify it accordingly. Discovering new fashion styles and connecting with the fashion community is the key that this app offers to improve our wardrobes.

## Top Two to Three Scenarios
[see sample scenarios](https://github.com/mschray/IPro497Sample/blob/main/Examples/ScenarioExample.md)

### Your Scenario #1
- Jean has an important event to attend but he needs to dress to impress. He rushes himself to a local clothing store but the options just overwhelm him. He spots a flyer that mentions they can help him find an outfit in no time so he goes ahead and scans the barcode. He gets influenced by the many different styles and condenses his search by searching specific tags to fit his style but still leave room for creation. He especially likes this one outfit and decides to use that as his guide to purchase the clothing he needs to recreate the look. He wears the outfit to the event and everyone loves it! No more waiting around to find the perfect outfit for an event.

### Your Scenario #2
- Sean is scrolling through his TikTok For You Page when he comes across a video of his favorite fashion influencer promoting this application. He becomes interested in it and looks for a way to download the app. Fortunately, this fashion influencer included a link on their caption on their video so that they are able to download the app by copying and pasting the link into their web browser. Once they download the app, they’re set to start getting feedback on their outfits.

## Team Working Agreement (All team members)
### What do we want to accomplish/learn together?
- We want to create and design a practical app that would allow for fashion enthusiasts or individuals interested in fashion to rate and receive feedback on their most desirable outfits. We seek fundamental product management skills along with team collaboration and new frameworks and applications to use throughout our project. 
### Tools

- Github
- Discord

#### Examples 
- We will use Github for version control. Team-members will push their finished code to a branch to ensure the main branch remains bug-free.
- If we need to meet outside of class we have found a mutually agreeable time at: We will decide availability accordingly 
- If we need to meet outside of class we will use the following tool/tech for meetings: Discord
- When we are not meeting together we will use the following tool/tech for communications: Discord

### Requested Approach/Behavior 
- We will communicate respectfully in a professional manner. Discussions only. No arguing/name calling of any kind. Respect the ideas of each team member.
- We will divide work fairly. Each member will be responsible for the work they choose to be assigned to (based on their skillset). Each member should be assigned to one or more stories on the Kanban board.

### Unacceptable behavior

- Disrespectful Behavior: Treating others with disrespect
- Ignoring Feedback: Pushing away constructive criticism which could prevent further growth in the project
- Lack of Communication: Failure to communicate updates that could lead to confusion within the team 
- Discrimintation or Harassment: Any form of discrimination or harrasment towards race, gender, or background


### How will we productively solve disagreement

- In the event where an individual has shown unacceptable behavior we will productively solve disagreement through a verbal intervention to decompress and assess the situtation at hand before anything evolves to a larger event.
